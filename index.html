    <h1>The Rise of the Bitcoin Class</h1>

    <h2>How Crypto is Giving Power to the People</h2>

    <h3>With the global pandemic highlighting the inefficiency of government, it is no wonder a class of people are daring to
    try something new.</h3>
    <p>Financial analysts everywhere are predicting an exciting new trend. They say a brand new class of people are buying into
    cryptocurrency. What exactly started this trend? According to financial expert A ‚ÄúThe global pandemic has made a lot of
    people realize that they cannot trust their politicians, you know? They are not as safe as they thought. Their elected
    officials have been fickle and hypocritical about the rules and a lot of people are mad about that.‚Äù <br>

    Okay so, governments cannot be trusted. Duh. So why is it still difficult to convince people to invest in Bitcoin? There
are two main reasons: The first, and easiest to fix, is people don‚Äôt understand how Bitcoin works. This problem is
easily solvable; give someone an hour and an internet connection and they will understand cryptocurrency. Heck, they
might even be able to teach their Boomer parents, too. There are many free educational resources for people, so
ignorance is no longer an option. <br>

The second reason is much more ingrained. Our default settings tell us to look to a strong figure for safety and
authority‚Äîunfortunately this figure is often government. People are accustomed to relying on the system to allocate
funds for them. The thought of autonomy is frightening to many. The only person in charge of your finances is you, and
people are scared of the responsibility. When things go wrong, people automatically look to someone else to blame. In
our case, we blame the media, politicians, our parent‚Äôs generation, rich CEOs, and other figures of authority. What
people don‚Äôt understand is cryptocurrencies don‚Äôt rely on a third party to make things ‚Äúfair.‚Äù <br>

<b>In a cryptocurrency system, we are the figure of authority.</b> We are the ones to blame if something goes wrong. People
tend to ignore the major benefit: cryptocurrency promises <b>power to the people.</b> Where have we heard that phrase before? ü§î
(Hint: think major movements on 1970s American history, bonus points if you get it üòâ)
